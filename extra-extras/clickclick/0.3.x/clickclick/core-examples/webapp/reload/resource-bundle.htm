<h2>Resource Bundle Reload Demo</h2>

<p>
This page demonstrated that resource bundle properties can be reloaded on the fly. (You will need to have ClickClick Examples open in your IDE)
</p>
<p>
    To see it in action, change the value of <b>'myproperty'</b> in the resource bundle 
<br><b>'net/sf/clickclick/examples/page/reload/ResourceBundlePage.properties'</b>.
Make sure your IDE is setup to copy the updated 'ResourceBundlePage.properties' file to your web application build folder. Refresh the browser to see the new value.
</p>
<b>myproperty</b> -> $myproperty
