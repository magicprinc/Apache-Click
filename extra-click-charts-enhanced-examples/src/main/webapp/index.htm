   <p>
   This web application demonstrates usage of the click charts enhanced APIs.
   This project started on November 2010 as Apache Click only provided a
   limited support for charts.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   The click charts enhanced project aims to provide better and nicer charts for click.
   It offers an abstraction layer for charts and supports various javascript charting librairies.
   </p>

	<p>
   Currently, it supports both <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/">Flot</a> and <a href="www.jqplot.com/"> JQPlot</a>.
   The JQPlot support is almost complete and very structured compared to the flot support.
   </p>   

	<p>
	This application is an important learning resource, and will help you to get up and running with Click as soon as possible.

	This application allows you to view the Page source code, templates and config files online.
